          <h2>Week 0: Basecamp and Orientation</h2>
          <h5>29 August 2023</h5>
          <p>
            Well, we're off to the races! Here is the first post of this blog.
            It's a somewhat daunting task to get started, but I'll do my best.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last week, I attended my cohort's Basecamp and first Access Weekend.
            The "Basecamp" component involved an orientation to the program as a
            whole. It featured discussions concerning class times, logistics,
            and the cornucopia of resources available to my cohort during and
            after our time in the program. (Notably, a variety of team-building
            activities, including a high-ropes course and an impromptu
            volleyball game, were involved.) Meanwhile, the "Access Weekend"
            component involved attending the first actual classes of the
            program. The events lasted from Thursday through Sunday afternoon,
            and it was a blur of activity, new people, and free food. Although I
            had attended a few in-person admitted students events earlier in the
            year -- such as a summer Pirates game -- this weekend was the first
            time my entire cohort had gotten together in person.
          </p>
          <p>
            My cohort (PT26, short for "Part-Time 2026") is cool. I can't
            remember the exact number, but I'm pretty sure Meg (the Director of
            the part-time program) said that there are roughly 120 students in
            my group. Notably, that's 120 people enrolled in a rigorous graduate
            program while managing full-time jobs, families, hobbies, and all of
            the other things that life entails.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the demographics of the PT25 cohort are any indication of my own
            cohort's demographics, I fall squarely in the middle: I just turned
            30, I'm a white male, I live in the Mid-Atlantic, and I have a few
            years of work experience under my belt. In my cohort, there are
            product managers and recent graduates. There are fellow staff
            members of CMU, as well as at least one doctor and one surgeon.
            There are members of the Armed Forces. One younger-looking student
            has been to all 50 states and north of 50 countries, and another
            individual lives in Paris. Already there are folks wanting to join
            intramural teams and clubs (myself included). It's a solid group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the one area where I stand out the most is my undergraduate
            degree. While the demographics of the program illustrate that nearly
            90% of part-timers majored in business, finance, or a STEM-related
            field, I proudly studied Anthropology and Music at a small liberal
            arts school. In undergrad, I chose Anthropology because it was
            interesting to me and because I knew that I would always be working
            with people. Meanwhile, I minored in Music because I knew that it
            will always be a hobby of mine. That being said, I had a moment of
            profound joy when one of the first slides of the first lecture of
            the program had "Defining Culture" in big bold letters at the top. I
            knew I had a home at a quant-oriented program, but it sure was nice
            to see it in writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the three-year program, my classmates and I will each be
            taking two courses at a time, typically once a week in the evening.
            Each class is called a "Mini", and they last about seven weeks. Like
            everyone else in my cohort, my first two minis are called "Managing
            People and Teams" and "Probability and Statistics". I am already
            grateful for the balance between one quantitative course and one
            qualitative course. As someone who didn't take any math classes in
            college, a condition of my admission into the program involved
            passing an online "Math for Management" course before the Basecamp
            weekend. I needed to get an 80% or above, and I had two attempts. I
            got an impressively low 49% on the first attempt and then, after
            going through the modules and spending five hours on the test
            itself, scored a 91%. I quickly befriended a number of other
            students who also struggled through the "Math for Management" class,
            and we relived our experience together. I've honestly enjoyed math
            because I like the puzzle-solving aspect of it all, but that test
            sure stressed me out. I'm glad I wasn't the only one.
          </p>
          <p>
            One last thing I'll mention for now is the student panel. Over lunch
            during one day of the Basecamp component, there was a
            lunch-and-learn featuring a panel of five current part-time MBA
            students. The panel included a father of three looking to change
            industries; someone who had recently been hired after 18 months of
            looking for a job; and someone with a fantastically
            impressive-sounding title at a major tech company. When I asked the
            panel what they hoped to gain by going through the MBA program, I
            was struck by how each of them stated their desire to learn and grow
            their respective careers, regardless of where they worked now or how
            much money they made. I've always taken the mindset that I'll never
            really know what I want to be when I grow up, but I'll do my best at
            wherever I go, and I'll through perseverance and a healthy sense of
            humor. Ironically, the panelist with the fancy tech job title said
            the same thing.

          <p>I'm looking forward to the adventures to come.</p>
