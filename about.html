          <p>
            Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. My name's Matt, and I'm a software
            engineer. I am also a part-time student at Carnegie Mellon
            University, working towards my Masters in Business Administration.
          </p>
          <p>Something something about my background...</p>
          <p>
            Currently, I work on the IT side of things at Carnegie Mellon
            University. As a member of a small development team, I build and
            maintain a variety of applications that enable faculty, staff, and
            students to connect to and use campus networks.
          </p>
          <p>The motivations behind this blog are threefold:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              To chronicle my journey towards earning an MBA while working
              full-time;
            </li>
            <li>
              To provide an honest perspective of an employee of a university
              using his tuition benefits to earn a degree from said university
              (a perspective that was challenging to glean leading up to my
              enrollment in the program);
            </li>
            <li>
              To finally write a blog of some kind during a relatively
              significant life event, something that's been encouraged by family
              and friends (thanks, Mom).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            My goal is to publish a post about once a week throughout the
            duration of the program. If you like what you see or have any
            questions, please reach out! I'm always looking to build out my
            network, and I'm happy to chat.
