            Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. My name's Matt, and I'm a software
            engineer, among other things. I'm also a part-time student at
            Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, working
            towards my Masters in Business Administration.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's been a bit of a winding road to get to this point. I studied
            Anthropology and Music in college while holding down jobs working
            with A/V-related tech and equipment on the campus special events and
            recording crews. After graduation, I completed one year of service
            each with AmeriCorps NCCC and AmeriCorps VISTA, and fell in love
            with the program. Afterwards, following a period of figuring out how
            to best merge my civic-oriented passions with the troubleshooting
            and tinkering skills I learned through my jobs in undergrad, I came
            to the realization that learning how to code would enable me to have
            an even bigger impact on things. (I was particularly inspired by
            organizations like 412 Food Rescue and Civic Actions.) With that in
            mind, I took a leap and enrolled in the Tech Elevator coding
            bootcamp program in 2019, and have worked in technology ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of late summer 2023, I've been in the tech field for four years
            now, but it often still feels like I'm just starting out. That said,
            I've worked to develop robotic process automation workflows to
            assist internal IT teams at a large national bank, and built out
            customized chat platform integrations to further streamline how
            information is communicated across departments. Currently, I work on
            the IT side of things at Carnegie Mellon University. As a member of
            a small development team, I build and maintain a variety of
            applications that enable faculty, staff, and students to connect to
            and use campus computer networks.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I'm content in my current role, it's always good to keep
            learning when working in the tech field. I also knew that I'd regret
            it forever if I didn't take advantage of the tuition benefits that
            come with working for a well-regarded university. To me, an MBA
            seemed like a natural choice: it's a widely-recognized credential
            across a variety of fields; it rounds out my beloved liberal arts
            education; and it's a terminal professional degree to boot. Come
            Spring 2026 (my graduation date), here's hoping that the MBA becomes
            the moniker of this blog: <u>M</u>att's <u>B</u>ig
            <u>A</u>chievement.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not entirely sure what the next three years will bring, nor have
            I any clue what will come after the program. But the motivations
            behind this blog are threefold:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              To chronicle my journey towards earning an MBA while working
              full-time;
            </li>
            <li>
              To provide the perspective of a university staff member using his
              tuition benefits to earn a degree from said university (a
              perspective that was challenging to glean leading up to my
              enrollment in the program);
            </li>
            <li>
              To finally write a blog of some kind during a relatively
              significant life event, something that's been encouraged by family
              and friends (thanks, Mom).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            My goal is to publish a post about once a week throughout the
            duration of the program. If you like what you see or have any
            questions, please reach out! I'm always looking to build out my
            network, and I'm happy to chat.
